				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>From 2020 to 2022, the rate of new COVID-19 cases was highest at the end of this range, in January of 2022.</li>
				<li>The rate of new COVID-19 cases seems to increase the most during the winter, then decrease later.</li>
				<li>New COVID_19 cases are generally becoming more and more frequent as time goes on.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					The graph uses a spiral to display data along the axis of time, such that data with the same date and different years are
					shown at the same angle, making it easy to compare information within a particular month, as well as track the data over
					several months. It's easy to see where new COVID-19 cases are at their highest, and where fluctuations repeat throughout the
					year.
				</li>
				<li>
					The arc length on the time axis representing a month gets longer as the graph progresses, having a similar effect to using an
					exponential scale for the time axis. This does not seem to have any purpose in the graph, and could mislead viewers into
					misinterpreting the rate of increase of COVID-19 cases.
				</li>
				<li>
					The graph uses minimal colors to indicate the data, and just enough labels are used to make the graph readable. It's also
					straightforward to find the start of the graph and read it through to the end. It would be nice if certain important events
					related to the pandemic were indicated at certain parts of the time axis, so inferences could be drawn about what caused
					certain fluctuations in COVID-19 rates.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/6.c35_a3_s1.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This graph concept is similar to the original graph, except that the time axis overlaps itself in a circle instead of spiraling
					away from the center. The data color also shifts along a gradient to indicate the year.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Since the time axis always remains the same distance from the center of the graph, the arc length for each month is now the
					same for every year in which there is data, removing any unwanted visual biases and making the data easier to read and interpret.
				</li>
				<li>
					Color would be used to indicate the year, instead of height. This graph would use a gradient on which it's easier to locate
					where certain colors are. But maybe the constant change in color would make it harder to differentiate between the years...
				</li>
				<li>
					The month labels are moved in towards the center, to give room to the graph data. They don't have to be rotated like they are
					in the sketch, as long as they are clearly visible.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="/Assignment_3/images/6.c35_a3_s2.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This graph displays the data as a sequence of line graphs for each year, removing the curvature entirely. Only one hue would be
					used for the data, just like in the original graph.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					This graph intends to make data easier to read by removing the circle shape of the original graph entirely, opting for sub-graphs
					that can be read like a typical piece of text. It's less visually interesting and unique, but I suppose not every graph has to
					be a work of art to get its point across.
				</li>
				<li>
					Separating the data by year into their own sub-graphs makes it easier to differentiate between each set of data, without the
					viewer having to check a legend to keep track of the years. As such, there is no longer any color in this graph.
				</li>
				<li>
					In fact, this graph has no legend at all. All of the labels are now embedded into the graph itself, like how the vertical axis
					shows the height of certain new case rates instead of the triangular width indicator from the original graph. I would've moved
					the year labels to the other side of the sub-graphs for clarity, but there were explicit instructions to write in pen. I don't
					want to find out what would happen if I wrote in pencil instead...
				</li>
			</ul>

			<figure>
				<img src="/Assignment_3/images/6.c35_a3_s3.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This is a simplified version of the sketch above, which combines all three sub-graphs into one graph. It's otherwise exactly
					the same as the previous sketch.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					The intention with this sketch was to simplify the display further by putting all of the data on the same set of axes, making
					comparisons between years even simpler.
				</li>
				<li>
					The axes and labels are left unchanged from the last sketch, except that the three lines are now labeled with their respective
					years. It might be a bit harder to differentiate between the years now, so maybe I would add color back in, for a layer of
					redundancy.
				</li>
				<li>
					While there are ticks for every month along the horizontal axis, The month labels only include January, April, July, and
					October. This was an arbitrary choice borrowed from the original graph, but I realize there isn't really any point in leaving
					out the other months, besides the fact that they might not all fit. We'll see how this axis looks in the final graph.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Final Visualization Design</h2>
      
			<figure>
				<img src="/Assignment_3/images/6.c35_a3_revision.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This is a revised version of the original graph, that aims to be easier to interpret than before. It actually includes more
					data than the original graph, specifically data from January to September of 2022.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				This graph displays the same data as the original graph, plus about 9 more months worth of data. It shows the confirmed new
				COVID-19 cases for each day as the average of the past 7 days including that day, just like the original graph. The purpose of this
				was to smooth out the data and show the general trend of fluctuation in new cases over time. The graph uses continuous lines to
				display this data, just like the original graph, because they are best suited for showing quantitative data in way that allows for
				comparing data points by scale and ratios. The graph is designed to facilitate comparisons of the same data across different years
				by having the data line wrap around from the right to the left, then shift colors to indicate different years. The axes and labels
				are meant to show as much information as possible, with some amount of redundancy in the year labels being color coded, to reduce
				the cognitive load on the viewer in understanding the graph.
      		</p>

      		<h3>Reflection</h3>

			<p>
				The main goal for this revision was to display the data for each year over time axes of the same scale. The main issue with the
				original graph was that each year's time axis had a larger circumference than the one before it, making comparisons between years
				slightly more challenging. In this graph, where the time axis progresses linearly and covers a single period of 12 months, it's now
				straightforward to find when certain critical points in the data occur, and how they compare to data points a year earlier or
				later. Discrete, dissimilar colors are used to better show what year the line is currently displaying data in. The circular shape is gone
				now, but at least the viewer no longer has to continuously rotate their head to scan the data. If one really wanted to, they could just
				print out the graph and tape the right and left sides together to make it circular again.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Additionally, the vertical axis indicates the levels of new COVID-19 cases with gridlines, making it much easier to see how many
				cases were confirmed on a particular date than comparing the relative widths of the data and the legend from the original graph. On
				that note, there are no legends whatsoever in this graph; the potential legend for the color-coded years is left out in favor of
				color-coded labels, simplifying the graph even further. The only potential issue is that the year labels are in reverse order when reading
				from left to right, but I don't anticipate that this will hinder the graph's comprehensibility at all.
