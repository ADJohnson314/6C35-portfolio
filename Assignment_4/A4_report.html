    <h2>Proposition: NYPD Civilian Complaints show that police officers tend to be biased against members of other races.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>
					This graph aggregates complaints against the NYPD by race, showing both the race of civilians sending complaints and the race
					of officers receiving them. The graph shows a spike in complaints from Black civilians to White police officers, signaling that
					Black civilians are unfairly discriminated against by the NYPD.

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>This dataset only included substantiated complaints, meaning that the NYPD itself agreed that these complaints were reasonable.
					I chose to filter out the unsubstantiated and exonerated complaints as a way of removing any bias that citizens would naturally
					have against police officers. Essentially, this is data that the NYPD would supposedly admit is representative of itself. Even
					when the data is filtered in their favor, the message of this graph is not very favorable... (Persuasion Score: 2)</li>
				<li>Specific colors were used to indicate the number of complaints sent between people of each pair of races in the dataset. I went
					with dark red to indicate a high number of complaints, and a light-yellow to indicate a low number of complaints (with white
					representing no complaints). I wanted to make it easy to differentiate between the colors, and I think I succeeded because the
					peak in the graph clearly stands out from the rest of it. The color choice is not particularly deceptive, but beyond a certain
					extent it only serves to support the proposition. (Persuasion Score: 1.5)</li>
				<li>The races of the citizens are ordered in the graph in the same sequence as the races of the officers. I did this so that it
					would be easy to find cells where both people involved in a complaint were the same race (they're all along the diagonal from
					the top-left to the bottom-right). The idea was to make any hypothetical discrimination easy to recognize: light colors along
					the diagonal, and dark colors everywhere else. I feel like the only purpose of ordering the races any other way would be to
					deceptively conceal any patterns between people of certain races. (Persuasion Score: 2)</li>
				<li>This graph has a rather neutral title, which I'm only just realizing was a design decision itself. I think I wanted to let the
					data alone convince the viewer of the message, instead of a title that suggests an opinion before the viewer has even processed
					the data. I suppose this decision was made in earnest, even though I wasn't aware of it until now. (Persuasion Score: 2)</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="/Assignment_4/images/Distributions of Board Dispositions, by Race.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This graph shows the proportion of disposition labels assigned to complaints from citizens of each race. "Unsubstantiated"
					means the complaint was considered unreasonable and ignored, "Substantiated" means that the NYPD agreed that one of their
					officers broke one or more of their rules, and "Exonerated" means that the NYPD acknowledged the complaint as reasonable, but
					did not agree that one of their officers broke any rules. Each pie chart is very similar to the others, suggesting that the
					NYPD handles all complaints in the same way, regardless of the race of the complainant.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>This set of pie charts is meant to show how the NYPD handles complaints from members of each race, by displaying the relative
					frequencies of dispositions assigned to each complaint (i.e. whether they accept complaints as reasonable or not.) The idea was
					to make a model to predict how the NYPD would respond to any given complaint, given only info about the race of the
					complainant. Even though I chose this representation of the data to contradict the other graph, I probably would've considered
					this model reasonable and earnest if I chose to create it before the previous graph. (Persuasion Score: 2)</li>
				<li>I chose to label the percentages of the pie charts so the viewer wouldn't have to estimate the proportions, and to better
					convince the viewer that they each displayed mostly the same distribution. Even then, there are differences greater than 5%
					between particular slices across the charts, which I consider to be statistically significant enough to disagree with that
					message. On top of that, I did make a conscious choice to conceal the raw counts of each set of complaints, as the disparity
					in counts would be a glaring contradiction to the message. (Persuasion Score: -1)</li>
				<li>Like the other graph, I also chose to give this one a neutral title. It wasn't really much to consider, but it doesn't give the
					graph a feeling of objectiveness and truthfulness, even though I did obscure some information elsewhere. (Persuasion Score: 2)</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>Going into this assignment, I expected to find it difficult to design a graph supporting the proposition, and to find it much easier to
		design one against the proposition. I was very surprised to see that it was actually the other way around; I practically designed the
		supporting graph on accident! Even when I tried to modify the graph in favor of the NYPD, the graph still painted a very convincing
		picture of bias within the police force. I also found that the decisions I used to design the graph against the proposition were more
		earnest than I expected, even though I still obscured some vital information to make it convincing. It all tells me that different
		visualizations can convey wildly different perspectives about the same data, even when they both are designed with the best intentions. So
		the best graphs are the ones that display as much data as possible in a form that's easiest to understand. I guess the real difference
		between an honest graph and a deceptive graph isn't in what they display, but in what they hide.</p>
