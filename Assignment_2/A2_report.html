			<h2>Subtheme: Historical Harms, Contemporary Effects</h2>
			<p>
				This analysis covers data on the existence of Redlining in Massachusetts. Redlining was the act of restricting loans to homes
				and buildings in certain regions of the country, based on the racial demographics of people in each region. This lead to a huge
				gap in wealth and access to homes between people of different races, which began in the 30's and is still experienced today, even
				though redlining was later outlawed in the 60's. This dataset shows where in Greater Boston redlining occured, including what
				regions were labeled as desirable or undesirable to issue loans to, as well as what type of buildings (commercial, industrial, or
				residential) were in each region.
			</p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					What races or ethnic groups were affected the most by redlining?
					<p>
						A good starting point in the exploration of this data is to compare the magnitudes of penalties from redlining between
						different races, to get a better idea of which people were considered most undeserving of loans, and who would benefit the
						most from any measures taken to undo the effects of redlining. Since the readings seem to focus more on how Black citizens
						were disadvantaged by redlining, my initial guess is that harsher ratings will be more prevalent in predominantly Black
						regions of Massachusetts.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					What correlation, if any, is there between the type of buildings in a region and the rating of that region?
					<p>
						I'd like to seek an answer to this question because it would show whether the effects of redlining extended beyond
						restricting access to housing. If commercial and industrial buildings were underfunded because of the presence of
						racial minorities, this might indicate that those citizens were given less opportunities for jobs than white citizens.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Which cities were affected the most by redlining? What aspects of each city went into deciding how much to redline them?
					<p>
						This question aims to show if there are any other aspects of a region besides race and building type that affected how it
						was rated.
