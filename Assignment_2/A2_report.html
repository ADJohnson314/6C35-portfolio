			<h2>Subtheme: Zoning and Housing Supply</h2>
			<p>
				One of the barriers preventing people from having affordable housing is the set of regulations on what types of buildings can be
				constructed in a certain area, called zoning. In the past, these regulations have been used to restrict certain types of people
				from owning homes in different parts of Massachusetts, usually by only allowing single-family homes to be built in an area, which
				are more expensive than other types of housing. This analysis covers data on where zoning exists in the state, including the 
				percentage of single-family homes in each municipality, and the race, age, and other demographics of the people living in an area.
				All municipalities in the dataset are under zoning.
			</p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					How have different groups of people been affected by exclusive zoning on housing, in the form of restricting building types to
					single-family homes?
					<p>
						I would like to compare the population of people living in municipalities where only single-family houses are allowed to
						the population of people living on less restrictive municipalities. This will better reveal the effects and likely motives
						behind zoning practices in Massachusetts.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					How does the total number of households in a municipality change as the percentage of single-family zoning change?
					<p>
						One of the consequences of zoning is that there are fewer homes in Massachusetts that are available to own and live in. I
						am curious of just how severe the regulation of single-family homes is towards reducing the number of existing homes,
						specifically how quickly does the number of homes drop as the amount of zoning increases.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					What are the gaps in income between people who live in single-family zoning municipalities versus people who don't?
					<p>
						This question aims to show just how important the presence of municipalities without zoning is in allowing people to afford
						homes. This analysis should consider how certain demographics affect this gap as well.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				<img src="images/fig1.png" alt="A bar chart with one bar labeled 'No single-family homes' with a measure of 463 people, and the
				other bar labeled 'Only single-family homes' with a measure of 319 people." />
				<figcaption>
				This chart compares municipalities with 0% single-family homes with those with 100% single-family homes. It shows that
				municipalities with only single-family homes are on average about 30% less populated than those with no single-family homes, which
				would suggest that single-family homes are limiting the capacity of a region in some way.
				</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/fig2.png" alt="A pair of pie charts, labeled 'No single-family homes' and 'Only single-family homes', both with
				slices labeled 'Male' and 'Female' that are almost equally sized." />
				<figcaption>
				To investigate the variation in population further, I aggregated the population data for no-single-family and only-single-family
				municipalities according to gender, age, and race, to compare the distributions of each. According to these two pie charts, there
				doesn't seem to be a significant difference between the male and female populations in either municipality type, so it probably
				isn't a relevant factor to zoning.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/fig3.png" alt="A pair of pie charts, labeled 'No single-family homes' and 'Only single-family homes', both with
				slices labeled 'under 18', '18-64', and '65+'. The 'Only single-family homes' pie has a slightly larger 'under 18' slice and a
				slightly smaller '65+' slice." />
				<figcaption>
				Similar to the gender pie charts, these charts show the distribution of ages in no-single-family and only-single-family
				municipalities. It seems that there are slightly more minors and slightly fewer seniors in regions with only single-family homes
				than in regions with no single-family homes. But the difference in distributions is less than 5%, so this probably isn't influenced
				by zoning either.
				</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/fig4.png" alt="A pair of pie charts, labeled 'No single-family homes' and 'Only single-family homes', both with
				slices labeled with various races. The 'Only single-family homes' pie has a slightly larger 'White' slice." />
				<figcaption>
				At this point, race would by the attribute of the population I would expect to be affected by zoning the most. I'm familiar with
				the practice of redlining, so I would understand if racial prejudices were at play when the restrictive housing regulations were
				placed. But the distrubutions of race between municipaity types seem to only differ by about 5%, which is the amount that the White
				population is larger in the set of only-single-family regions. Still, it seems that what little minority population there was in the
				no-single-family regions is scaled down significantly in the other regions, so maybe this was the cause and effect of zoning
				after all.

				<img src="images/fig5.png" alt="A bar chart with one bar labeled 'No single-family' with a measure of 818 people, and the
				other bar labeled 'Only single-family' with a measure of 741 people." />
				<figcaption>
				Moving on to households, it seems that the 100% single-family municipalities have almost the same number of homes as the 0%
				single-family municipalities. The relative scale between either set of regions is less severe than the relative scale of
				populations, which leads me to believe that single-family homes house fewer people on average than other types of homes.

			<figure>
				<img src="images/fig6.png" alt="A histogram with two sets of bars labeled 'No single-family' and 'Only single-family', with
				trendlines for both sets. The bars are ordered by intervals of income amounts." />
				<figcaption>
				I expected affordability to be a huge component in how zoning prevents people from owning and maintaining a home. Sure enough, This
				histrogram shows a difference is distribution of incomes between people in no-SF regions and people in only-SF regions. It is a bit
				subtle, but the no-SF distribution is a little further left in the chart than the only-SF distribution, meaning that there are more
				no-SF households with low incomes than only-SF households, and there are more only-SF households with high incomes than no-SF
				households. This would indicate that single-family homes probably require higher incomes to keep, because they are just more
				expensive to pay off.

				<img src="images/fig7.png" alt="A histogram with two sets of bars labeled 'No single-family' and 'Only single-family', with
				trendlines for both sets. The bars are ordered by household size." />
				<figcaption>
				After investigating the differences in income, I was curious if there really was a measurable difference in household sizes between
				the two types of municipalities, like I hypothesized eariler. To my surprise, it would seem that I was likely incorrect. According
				to this chart, single-family households generally hold more people than other households. So lack of space is probably not a
				contributing factor to the issues with zoning. As a clarification, both family and non-family households are included in the
				displayed data.

				<img src="images/fig8.png" alt="A histogram with two sets of bars labeled 'No single-family' and 'Only single-family', with
				trendlines for both sets. The bars are ordered by income per person." />
				<figcaption>
				This last visualization compares the income per person for different households. I estimated the incomes for each household using
				the given intervals in the dataset, then I multiplied together fractions of households with different attributes from the last two
				visualizations (income amount and household size). Then I divided the estimated income amounts by each household size to estimate
				the income per person for each product. The result is a histogram displaying income amounts with the estimated portion of
				households from each municipality type that have that amount. The result is similar to Figure 6, in that single-family households
				seem to have more income-per-person than the other households.
